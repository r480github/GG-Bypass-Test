## About Galaxyüìë

Galaxy is a minimalistic open source proxy that is capable of evading internet censorship. Galaxy uses Chemical.JS, which is harder to detect and fast. It also contains a vast collection of games that will continuously expand as the site grows. Join [Falcon Networks](https://discord.gg/xM8FvSAttG) for more links!
